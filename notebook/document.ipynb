Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

With the continuous advancement of neural net-\\nworks and deep learning, text embeddings have evolved from early sparse representa-\\ntions (e.g., BM25[1]) to dense representations based on ﬁne-tuned deep networks such\\nas BERT[2] and T5[3], leading to signiﬁcant performance improvements[4][5][6][7][8]. In\\n2022, the rise of large language models (LLMs), exempliﬁed by ChatGPT[9], ushered in\\na new era of text embeddings based on LLM representations, including models like text-\\nembedding-3-large and RepLLaMA[10]. Recent research on optimizing text embedding\\nmodels has explored diverse perspectives and focal points. For instance, to address\\nthe limitation of decoder-only architectures—where causal attention mechanisms re-\\nstrict token embeddings to unidirectional semantic capture—several approaches have\\nbeen proposed: Echo Embedding[11] employs input repetition and instruction design\\nto enable preceding tokens to capture subsequent token semantics. LLM2Vec[12] modi-\\nﬁes attention to bi-directional mechanism to remove backward dependency constraints.\\nConan-Embedding-v2[13] proposes a novel soft masking mechanism combined with dy-\\nnamic rank reduction.\\nAnother widely adopted approach is knowledge distillation,\\nwhere text embeddings are treated as the ”signal states” representing textual seman-\\ntics. By distilling knowledge from high-performing teacher models to student models,\\nthe objective is to optimize the embedding performance. For instance, Jasper[14] em-\\nploys a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework, combining with multiple carefully\\ndesigned loss functions and ﬁnally achieving superior results. Debater[16] proposes a\\nstep-by-step thinking mechanism for embedding generation, iteratively optimizing doc-\\nument representations through continuous COT. Distillation is applied to constrain\\nthe ﬁnal token representation to learn the optimal semantic states from these thinking\\nsteps. Additionally, hard negative sampling has emerged as a crucial research direc-\\ntion in text embedding models, serving as a pivotal technique for model optimization.\\nANCE[18] identiﬁed that conventional dense retrieval training leads to diminishing gra-\\ndient norms during optimization. Thus they developed an asynchronous Approximate\\nNearest Neighbor (ANN) indexing mechanism that periodically refreshes the negative\\nsample pool using the current model parameters, thereby ensuring the maintenance\\nof up-to-date and optimally challenging negative samples. Both Conan-Embedding[24]\\nand its v2 version incorporated similar dynamic hard negative sampling techniques to\\nenhance model performance. NV-Embed[19] implemented an alternative approach by\\nleveraging their previously developed NV-Retriever’s[20] positive-aware negative min-\\ning strategy, including TopK-MarginPos and TopKPercPos ﬁltering mechanisms.\\nIn this work, we present QZhou-Embedding, built upon the powerful Qwen2.5-7B-\\nInstruct[21] model, which pushes the boundaries of text embedding capabilities. To\\nenhance the model’s semantic understanding, we designed a uniﬁed multi-task learn-\\ning framework that not only accommodates more diverse training data but also bring\\neﬃcient learning across three key tasks: retrieval, natural language inference (NLI),\\nand classiﬁcation. Our framework comprises two core components: 1. Data Trans-\\nformation: We carefully adapt data formats to the speciﬁc requirements of retrieval,\\nNLI, and classiﬁcation tasks, enabling eﬀective feature extraction from heterogeneous\\ndata sources, signiﬁcantly beneﬁting retrieval model training. 2.

Our approach distinctively reformulates NLI tasks into\\ntext pair-score formats compatible with Cosent loss[49] training strategy, where sample\\npairs are quantitatively scored based on their semantic relationships. The processing\\nprocedures for each are detailed below:\\n• STS Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is characterized by its symmetric se-\\nmantic matching to determine whether two sentences share equivalent meaning.\\nSTS datasets typically consist of sentence pairs with associated labels, which may\\nbe binary classiﬁcations (yes/no, true/false) or numerical scores (e.g., 1.2, 3.1,\\n4.8). For binary labels, ”yes”/”true” are mapped to a numerical value of 1, while\\n”no”/”false” are converted to 0. The data is then structured into (query, docu-\\nment, score) triplets. Due to the symmetric nature of STS, each single original\\ndata sample can generate two training triplets by interchanging the query and\\npositive document roles.\\n• Textual Entailment Textual entailment further examines a model’s capabilities\\nin reasoning, typically featuring three-class labels: entailment, neutral, contradic-\\ntion.\\nOur processing method employs a three-tier scoring system: labels are\\nassigned values of 2, 1, and 0 for entailment, neutral, and contradiction respec-\\ntively. We construct (query, document, score) triplets accordingly, and similarly\\nleverage symmetry to double the dataset size.\\n3.2.3\\nCLS-oriented Process\\nClassiﬁcation tasks encompass text categorization and sentiment classiﬁcation scenar-\\nios, it typically follows a (text, label) format, where texts within the same category\\nexhibit semantic proximity while distinct boundaries separate diﬀerent classes. NV-\\nEmbed[47] compared label-based and example-based data construction methods, with\\nexperimental results demonstrating the superiority of the latter. Adopting the example-\\nbased approach, we process classiﬁcation data (text, label) by using the text as query,\\n7'),\n",

We designed a\\nuniﬁed multi-task framework comprising specialized data transformation and training\\nstrategies, eﬀectively enhanced the diversity of training data. To further improve the\\nquality of training data and the model’s generalization capabilities, we developed a data\\nsynthesis pipeline leveraging LLM API, incorporating techniques such as Paraphrasing,\\nAugmentation, and Hard negative example generation. We employ a two-stage training\\nstrategy comprising initial retrieval-focused training followed by full-task ﬁne-tuning,\\nenabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities based on robust retrieval per-\\nformance.\\nThe model achieves state-of-the-art results on the MTEB and CMTEB\\nbenchmarks, ranking ﬁrst on both leaderboards. Our ﬁndings establish that data qual-\\nity and diversity are pivotal for improving embedding model capabilities. In the future,\\nwe will focus on developing multimodal and multilingual embedding models, as well\\nas exploring eﬀective applications of embedding models in agent systems, aiming to\\nintegrate cutting-edge technologies to optimize this classical module.\\nReferences\\n[1] Robertson, Stephen E., and Steve Walker. ”Some simple eﬀective approximations to\\nthe 2-poisson model for probabilistic weighted retrieval.” In SIGIR’94: Proceedings\\n16'),\n",

Traditional object detection\\nmethods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable\\narchitectures. Their performance easily stagnates by construct-\\ning complex ensembles that combine multiple low-level image\\nfeatures with high-level context from object detectors and scene\\nclassiﬁers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more\\npowerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level,\\ndeeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing\\nin traditional architectures. These models behave differently in\\nnetwork architecture, training strategy, and optimization func-\\ntion. In this paper, we provide a review of deep learning-based\\nobject detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief\\nintroduction on the history of deep learning and its representative\\ntool, namely, the convolutional neural network. Then, we focus\\non typical generic object detection architectures along with some\\nmodiﬁcations and useful tricks to improve detection performance\\nfurther. As distinct speciﬁc detection tasks exhibit different\\ncharacteristics, we also brieﬂy survey several speciﬁc tasks,\\nincluding salient object detection, face detection, and pedestrian\\ndetection. Experimental analyses are also provided to compare\\nvarious methods and draw some meaningful conclusions. Finally,\\nseveral promising directions and tasks are provided to serve as\\nguidelines for future work in both object detection and relevant\\nneural network-based learning systems.\\nIndex Terms—Deep learning, neural network, object detection.\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nT\\nO GAIN a complete image understanding, we should\\nnot only concentrate on classifying different images but\\nalso try to precisely estimate the concepts and locations\\nof objects contained in each image. This task is referred\\nas object detection [1], [S1], which usually consists of dif-\\nferent subtasks such as face detection [2], [S2], pedestrian\\ndetection [3], [S2], and skeleton detection [4], [S3]. As one of\\nthe fundamental computer vision problems, object detection\\nis able to provide valuable information for semantic under-\\nstanding of images and videos and is related to many applica-\\ntions, including image classiﬁcation [5], [6], human behavior\\nanalysis [7], [S4], face recognition [8], [S5], and autonomous\\ndriving [9], [10].

However, due\\nto large variations in viewpoints, poses, occlusions, and light-\\ning conditions, it is difﬁcult to perfectly accomplish object\\ndetection with an additional object localization task. Therefore,\\nmuch attention has been attracted to this ﬁeld in recent\\nyears [15]–[18].\\nThe problem deﬁnition of object detection is to determine\\nwhere objects are located in a given image (object localization)\\nand which category each object belongs to (object classiﬁca-\\ntion). Therefore, the pipeline of traditional object detection\\nmodels can be mainly divided into three stages: informative\\nregion selection, feature extraction, and classiﬁcation.\\nA. Informative Region Selection\\nAs different objects may appear in any positions of the\\nimage and have different aspect ratios or sizes, it is a natural\\nchoice to scan the whole image with a multiscale sliding\\nwindow. Although this exhaustive strategy can ﬁnd out all\\npossible positions of the objects, its shortcomings are also\\nobvious. Due to a large number of candidate windows, it is\\ncomputationally expensive and produces too many redundant\\nwindows. However, if only a ﬁxed number of sliding window\\ntemplates is applied, unsatisfactory regions may be produced.\\nB. Feature Extraction\\nTo recognize different objects, we need to extract visual\\nfeatures that can provide a semantic and robust represen-\\ntation. Scale-invariant feature transform [19], histograms of\\noriented gradients (HOG) [20], and Haar-like [21] features are\\nthe representative ones. This is due to the fact that these\\nfeatures can produce representations associated with complex\\ncells in human brain [19]. However, due to the diversity of\\nappearances, illumination conditions, and backgrounds, it is\\ndifﬁcult to manually design a robust feature descriptor to\\nperfectly describe all kinds of objects.\\nC. Classiﬁcation\\nBesides, a classiﬁer is needed to distinguish a target object\\nfrom all the other categories and to make the representations\\nmore hierarchical, semantic, and informative for visual recog-\\nnition. Usually, the supported vector machine (SVM) [22],\\nAdaBoost [23], and deformable part-based model (DPM) [24]\\nare good choices. Among these classiﬁers, the DPM is a\\nﬂexible model by combining object parts with deformation\\ncost to handle severe deformations. In DPM, with the aid\\nof a graphical model, carefully designed low-level features\\nand kinematically inspired part decompositions are combined.\\n2162-237X © 2019 IEEE.

However,\\nsmall gains are obtained during 2010–2012 by only building\\nensemble systems and employing minor variants of successful\\nmethods [15]. This fact is due to the following reasons: 1) the\\ngeneration of candidate bounding boxes (BBs) with a sliding\\nwindow strategy is redundant, inefﬁcient, and inaccurate and\\n2) the semantic gap cannot be bridged by the combination\\nof manually engineered low-level descriptors and discrimina-\\ntively trained shallow models.\\nThanks\\nto\\nthe\\nemergency\\nof\\ndeep\\nneural\\nnetworks\\n(DNNs) [6], [26], [S7], a more signiﬁcant gain is obtained\\nwith the introduction of regions with convolutional neural\\nnetwork (CNN) features (R-CNN) [15]. DNNs, or the most\\nrepresentative CNNs, act in a quite different way from tra-\\nditional approaches. They have deeper architectures with the\\ncapacity to learn more complex features than the shallow ones.\\nAlso, the expressivity and robust training algorithms allow to\\nlearn informative object representations without the need to\\ndesign features manually [27].\\nSince the proposal of R-CNN, a great deal of improved\\nmodels have been suggested, including fast R-CNN that\\njointly optimizes classiﬁcation and bounding box regres-\\nsion tasks [16], faster R-CNN that takes an additional sub-\\nnetwork to generate region proposals [17], and you only\\nlook once (YOLO) that accomplishes object detection via a\\nﬁxed-grid regression [18]. All of them bring different degrees\\nof detection performance improvements over the primary\\nR-CNN and make real-time and accurate object detection more\\nachievable.\\nIn\\nthis\\npaper,\\na\\nsystematic\\nreview\\nis\\nprovided\\nto\\nsummarize representative models and their different char-\\nacteristics in several application domains, including generic\\nobject detection [15]–[17], salient object detection [28], [29],\\nface detection [30]–[32], and pedestrian detection [33], [34].\\nTheir relationships are depicted in Fig. 1. Based on basic\\nCNN architectures, the generic object detection is achieved\\nwith bounding box regression, while salient object detec-\\ntion is accomplished with local contrast enhancement and\\npixel-level segmentation. Face detection and pedestrian detec-\\ntion are closely related to generic object detection and\\nmainly accomplished with multiscale adaption and multi-\\nfeature fusion/boosting forest, respectively. The dotted lines\\nindicate that the corresponding domains are associated with\\neach other under certain conditions. It should be noticed\\nthat the covered domains are diversiﬁed. Pedestrian and face\\nimages have regular structures, while general objects and scene\\nimages have more complex variations in geometric structures\\nand layouts. Therefore, different deep models are required by\\nvarious images.\\nThere has been a relevant pioneer effort [35] which mainly\\nfocuses on relevant software tools to implement deep learning\\ntechniques for image classiﬁcation and object detection but\\npays little attention on detailing speciﬁc algorithms. Different\\nfrom it, our work not only reviews deep learning-based object\\ndetection models and algorithms covering different applica-\\ntion domains in detail but also provides their corresponding\\nexperimental comparisons and meaningful analyses.\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,\\na brief introduction on the history of deep learning and the\\nbasic architecture of CNN is provided. Generic object detec-\\ntion architectures are presented in Section III. Then, reviews\\nof CNN applied in several speciﬁc tasks, including salient\\nobject detection, face detection, and pedestrian detection, are\\nexhibited in Section IV–VI, respectively. Several promising\\nfuture directions are proposed in Section VII. At last, some\\nconcluding remarks are presented in Section VIII.\\nII. BRIEF OVERVIEW OF DEEP LEARNING\\nPrior to an overview on deep learning-based object detection\\napproaches, we provide a review on the history of deep\\nlearning along with an introduction on the basic architecture\\nand advantages of CNN.\\nA. History: Birth, Decline, and Prosperity\\nDeep models can be referred to as neural networks with\\ndeep structures. The history of neural networks can date\\nback to the 1940s [36], and the original intention was to\\nsimulate the human brain system to solve general learning\\nproblems in a principled way. It was popular in the 1980s and\\n1990s with the proposal of the back-propagation algorithm\\nby Rumelhart et al. [37]. However, due to the overﬁtting of\\ntraining, lack of large-scale training data, limited computation\\npower, and insigniﬁcance in performance compared with other\\nmachine learning tools, neural networks fell out of fashion in\\nthe early 2000s.\\nDeep learning has become popular since 2006 [26], [S7],\\nwith a breakthrough in speech recognition [38]. The recovery\\nof deep learning can be attributed to the following factors.\\n1) The emergence of large-scale annotated training data,\\nsuch as ImageNet [39], to fully exhibit its very large\\nlearning capacity.\\n2) Fast development of high-performance parallel comput-\\ning systems, such as GPU clusters.\\n3) Signiﬁcant advances in the design of network structures\\nand training strategies. With unsupervised and layerwise\\npretraining guided by autoencoder [40] or restricted\\nBoltzmann machine [41], a good initialization is pro-\\nvided. With dropout and data augmentation, the over-\\nﬁtting problem in training has been relieved [6], [42].'),\n",

Meanwhile, various\\nnetwork structures, such as AlexNet [6], Overfeat [44],\\nGoogLeNet [45], Visual Geometry Group (VGG) [46],\\nand Residual Net (ResNet) [47], have been extensively\\nstudied to improve the performance.\\nWhat prompts deep learning to have a huge impact on\\nthe entire academic community? It may owe to the con-\\ntribution of Hinton’s group, whose continuous efforts have\\ndemonstrated that deep learning would bring a revolutionary\\nbreakthrough on grand challenges rather than just obvious\\nimprovements on small data sets. Their success results from\\ntraining a large CNN on 1.2 million labeled images together\\nwith a few techniques [6] [e.g., rectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU)\\noperation [48] and “dropout” regularization].\\nB. Architecture and Advantages of CNN\\nCNN is the most representative model of deep learning [27].\\nA typical CNN architecture, which is referred to as VGG16,\\ncan be found in Fig. S1 in the supplementary material. Each\\nlayer of CNN is known as a feature map. The feature map\\nof the input layer is a 3-D matrix of pixel intensities for\\ndifferent color channels (e.g., RGB). The feature map of\\nany internal layer is an induced multichannel image, whose\\n“pixel” can be viewed as a speciﬁc feature. Every neu-\\nron is connected with a small portion of adjacent neurons\\nfrom the previous layer (receptive ﬁeld). Different types of\\ntransformations [6], [49], [50] can be conducted on feature\\nmaps, such as ﬁltering and pooling. Filtering (convolution)\\noperation convolutes a ﬁlter matrix (learned weights) with\\nthe values of a receptive ﬁeld of neurons and takes a non-\\nlinear function (such as sigmoid [51], ReLU) to obtain ﬁnal\\nresponses. Pooling operation, such as max pooling, average\\npooling, L2-pooling, and local contrast normalization [52],\\nsummarizes the responses of a receptive ﬁeld into one value\\nto produce more robust feature descriptions.\\nWith an interleave between convolution and pooling, an ini-\\ntial feature hierarchy is constructed, which can be ﬁne-tuned\\nin a supervised manner by adding several fully connected (FC)\\nlayers to adapt to different visual tasks. According to the tasks\\ninvolved, the ﬁnal layer with different activation functions [6]\\nis added to get a speciﬁc conditional probability for each\\noutput neuron. The whole network can be optimized on an\\nobjective function (e.g., mean squared error or cross-entropy\\nloss) via the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The\\ntypical VGG16 has totally 13 convolutional (conv) layers,\\n3 FC layers, 3 max-pooling layers, and a softmax classiﬁcation\\nlayer. The conv feature maps are produced by convoluting\\n3*3 ﬁlter windows, and feature map resolutions are reduced\\nwith 2 stride max-pooling layers. An arbitrary test image of the\\nsame size as training samples can be processed with the trained\\nnetwork. Rescaling or cropping operations may be needed if\\ndifferent sizes are provided [6].\\nThe advantages of CNN against traditional methods can be\\nsummarized as follows.\\n1) Hierarchical\\nfeature\\nrepresentation,\\nwhich\\nis\\nthe\\nmultilevel representations from pixel to\\nhigh-level\\nsemantic features learned by a hierarchical multistage\\nFig.\\n2.\\nTwo\\ntypes\\nof\\nframeworks:\\nregion\\nproposal\\nbased\\nand\\nregression/classiﬁcation based. SPP: spatial pyramid pooling [64], FRCN:\\nfaster R-CNN [16], RPN: region proposal network [17], FCN: fully con-\\nvolutional network [65], BN: batch normalization [43], and Deconv layers:\\ndeconvolution layers [54]\\n.\\nstructure [15], [53], can be learned from data automati-\\ncally and hidden factors of input data can be disentan-\\ngled through multilevel nonlinear mappings.\\n2) Compared with traditional shallow models, a deeper\\narchitecture provides an exponentially increased expres-\\nsive capability.\\n3) The architecture of CNN provides an opportunity to\\njointly optimize several related tasks together (e.g., fast\\nR-CNN combines classiﬁcation and bounding box\\nregression into a multitask learning manner).\\n4) Beneﬁtting from the large learning capacity of deep\\nCNNs, some classical computer vision challenges can\\nbe recast as high-dimensional data transform problems\\nand solved from a different viewpoint.\\nDue to these advantages, CNN has been widely applied\\ninto\\nmany research ﬁelds,\\nsuch\\nas\\nimage superresolu-\\ntion reconstruction [54], [55], image classiﬁcation [5], [56],\\nimage retrieval [57], [58], face recognition [8], [S5], pedes-\\ntrian detection [59]–[61], and video analysis [62], [63].\\nIII. GENERIC OBJECT DETECTION\\nGeneric object detection aims at locating and classifying\\nexisting objects in any one image and labeling them with\\nrectangular BBs to show the conﬁdences of existence. The\\nframeworks of generic object detection methods can mainly\\nbe categorized into two types (see Fig. 2). One follows the tra-\\nditional object detection pipeline, generating region proposals\\nat ﬁrst and then classifying each proposal into different object\\ncategories. The other regards object detection as a regression\\nor classiﬁcation problem, adopting a uniﬁed framework to\\nachieve ﬁnal results (categories and locations) directly. The\\nregion proposal-based methods mainly include R-CNN [15],\\nspatial pyramid pooling (SPP)-net [64], Fast R-CNN [16],\\nFaster R-CNN [17], region-based fully convolutional network\\n(R-FCN) [65], feature pyramid networks (FPN)\\n[66], and\\nMask R-CNN [67], some of which are correlated with each\\nother (e.g., SPP-net modiﬁes R-CNN with an SPP layer).\\nThe regression/classiﬁcation-based methods mainly include\\nMultiBox [68], AttentionNet [69], G-CNN [70], YOLO [18],\\nSingle Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) [71], YOLOv2 [72],\\ndeconvolutional single shot detector (DSSD) [73], and deeply\\nsupervised object detectors (DSOD) [74]. The correlations\\nbetween these two pipelines are bridged by the anchors\\nintroduced in Faster R-CNN. Details of these methods are as\\nfollows.'),\n",

Region Proposal-Based Framework\\nThe region proposal-based framework, a two-step process,\\nmatches the attentional mechanism of the human brain to\\nsome extent, which gives a coarse scan of the whole scenario\\nﬁrst and then focuses on regions of interest (RoIs). Among\\nthe prerelated works [44], [75], [76], the most representative\\none is Overfeat [44]. This model inserts CNN into the sliding\\nwindow method, which predicts BBs directly from locations\\nof the topmost feature map after obtaining the conﬁdences of\\nunderlying object categories.\\n1) R-CNN: It is of signiﬁcance to improve the quality\\nof candidate BBs and to take a deep architecture to extract\\nhigh-level features. To solve these problems, R-CNN was\\nproposed by Girshick et al. [15] and obtained a mean average\\nprecision (mAP) of 53.3% with more than 30% improvement\\nover the previous best result (DPM histograms of sparse\\ncodes [77]) on PASCAL VOC 2012. Fig. 3 shows the ﬂow-\\nchart of R-CNN, which can be divided into three stages as\\nfollows.\\na) Region Proposal Generation: The R-CNN adopts\\nselective search [78] to generate about 2000 region proposals\\nfor each image. The selective search method relies on simple\\nbottom-up (BU) grouping and saliency cues to provide more\\naccurate candidate boxes of arbitrary sizes quickly and to\\nreduce the searching space in object detection [24], [39].\\nb) CNN-Based Deep Feature Extraction: In this stage,\\neach region proposal is warped or cropped into a ﬁxed\\nresolution, and the CNN module in [6] is utilized to extract\\na 4096-dimensional feature as the ﬁnal representation. Due\\nto large learning capacity, dominant expressive power, and\\nhierarchical structure of CNNs, a high-level, semantic, and\\nrobust feature representation for each region proposal can be\\nobtained.\\nc) Classiﬁcation\\nand\\nLocalization:\\nWith\\npretrained\\ncategory-speciﬁc linear SVMs for multiple classes, different\\nregion proposals are scored on a set of positive regions and\\nbackground (negative) regions. The scored regions are then\\nadjusted with bounding box regression and ﬁltered with a\\ngreedy nonmaximum suppression (NMS) to produce ﬁnal BBs\\nfor preserved object locations.\\nWhen\\nthere\\nare\\nscarce\\nor\\ninsufﬁcient\\nlabeled\\ndata,\\npretraining is usually conducted. Instead of unsupervised\\npretraining [79], R-CNN ﬁrst conducts supervised pretraining\\non ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Competition,\\na very large auxiliary data set, and then takes a domain-speciﬁc\\nﬁne-tuning. This scheme has been adopted by most of the\\nsubsequent approaches [16], [17].\\nIn spite of its improvements over traditional methods and\\nsigniﬁcance in bringing CNN into practical object detection,\\nthere are still some disadvantages.\\n1) Due to the existence of FC layers, the CNN requires a\\nﬁxed size (e.g., 227 × 227) input image, which directly\\nleads to the recomputation of the whole CNN for each\\nevaluated region, taking a great deal of time in the testing\\nperiod.\\n2) Training of R-CNN is a multistage pipeline. At ﬁrst,\\na convolutional network (ConvNet) on object proposals\\nis ﬁne-tuned. Then, the softmax classiﬁer learned by\\nﬁne-tuning is replaced by SVMs to ﬁt in with ConvNet\\nfeatures. Finally, bounding-box regressors are trained.\\n3) Training is expensive in space and time. Features are\\nextracted from different region proposals and stored on\\nthe disk. It will take a long time to process a relatively\\nsmall training set with very deep networks, such as\\nVGG16. At the same time, the storage memory required\\nby these features should also be a matter of concern.\\n4) Although selective search can generate region propos-\\nals with relatively high recalls, the obtained region\\nproposals are still redundant and this procedure is\\ntime-consuming (around 2 s to extract 2000 region\\nproposals).\\nTo\\nsolve\\nthese\\nproblems, many\\nmethods have been\\nproposed. Geodesic object proposals [80] takes a much faster\\ngeodesic-based segmentation to replace traditional graph\\ncuts. Mutiscale combinatorial grouping [81] searches different\\nscales of the image for multiple hierarchical segmentations and\\ncombinatorially groups different regions to produce proposals.\\nInstead of extracting visually distinct segments, the edge boxes\\nmethod [82] adopts the idea that objects are more likely to\\nexist in BBs with fewer contours straggling their boundaries.\\nAlso, some studies tried to rerank or reﬁne preextracted\\nregion proposals to remove unnecessary ones and obtained a\\nlimited number of valuable ones, such as DeepBox [83] and\\nSharpMask [84].\\nIn addition, there are some improvements to solve the\\nproblem of inaccurate localization. Zhang et al. [85] utilized\\na Bayesian optimization-based search algorithm to guide\\nthe regressions of different BBs sequentially and trained\\nclass-speciﬁc CNN classiﬁers with a structured loss to penal-\\nize the localization inaccuracy explicitly. Gupta et al.\\n[86]\\nimproved object detection for RGB-D images with seman-\\ntically rich image and depth features and learned a new\\ngeocentric embedding for depth images to encode each pixel.\\nThe combination of object detectors and superpixel classi-\\nﬁcation framework gains a promising result on the seman-\\ntic scene segmentation task. Ouyang et al. [87] proposed a\\ndeformable deep CNN (DeepID-Net) that introduces a novel\\ndeformation constrained pooling (def-pooling) layer to impose\\ngeometric penalty on the deformation of various object parts\\nand makes an ensemble of models with different settings.\\nLenc and Vedaldi [88] provided an analysis on the role of\\nproposal generation in CNN-based detectors and tried to\\nreplace this stage with a constant and trivial region generation\\nscheme. The goal is achieved by biasing sampling to match\\nthe statistics of the ground truth BBs with K-means clustering.'),\n",

That\\nis why R-CNN chooses to warp or crop each region proposal\\ninto the same size. However, the object may exist partly in\\nthe cropped region and unwanted geometric distortion may be\\nproduced due to the warping operation. These content losses or\\ndistortions will reduce recognition accuracy, especially when\\nthe scales of objects vary.\\nTo solve this problem, He et al. [64] took the theory of\\nspatial pyramid matching (SPM) [89], [90] into consideration\\nand proposed a novel CNN architecture named SPP-net. SPM\\ntakes several ﬁner to coarser scales to partition the image into\\na number of divisions and aggregates quantized local features\\ninto mid-level representations.\\nThe architecture of SPP-net for object detection can be\\nfound in Fig. 4. Different from R-CNN, SPP-net reuses\\nfeature maps of the ﬁfth conv layer (conv5) to project region\\nproposals of arbitrary sizes to ﬁxed-length feature vectors. The\\nfeasibility of the reusability of these feature maps is due to\\nthe fact that the feature maps not only involve the strength of\\nlocal responses but also have relationships with their spatial\\npositions [64]. The layer after the ﬁnal conv layer is referred to\\nas the SPP layer. If the number of feature maps in conv5 is 256,\\ntaking a three-level pyramid, the ﬁnal feature vector for each\\nregion proposal obtained after the SPP layer has a dimension\\nof 256 × (12 + 22 + 42) = 5376.\\nSPP-net not only gains better results with a correct estima-\\ntion of different region proposals in their corresponding scales\\nbut also improves detection efﬁciency in the testing period\\nwith the sharing of computation cost before SPP layer among\\ndifferent proposals.\\n3) Fast R-CNN: Although SPP-net has achieved impressive\\nimprovements in both accuracy and efﬁciency over R-CNN,\\nit still has some notable drawbacks. SPP-net takes almost the\\nsame multistage pipeline as R-CNN, including feature extrac-\\ntion, network ﬁne-tuning, SVM training, and bounding-box\\nregressor ﬁtting. Therefore, an additional expense on storage\\nspace is still required. In addition, the conv layers preceding\\nthe SPP layer cannot be updated with the ﬁne-tuning algorithm\\nintroduced in [64]. As a result, an accuracy drop of very deep\\nnetworks is unsurprising. To this end, Girshick [16] introduced\\na multitask loss on classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\nand proposed a novel CNN architecture named Fast R-CNN.\\nThe architecture of Fast R-CNN is exhibited in Fig. 5.\\nSimilar to SPP-net, the whole image is processed with conv\\nlayers to produce feature maps. Then, a ﬁxed-length feature\\nvector is extracted from each region proposal with an RoI\\nFig. 5.\\nArchitecture of Fast R-CNN [16].\\npooling layer. The RoI pooling layer is a special case of the\\nSPP layer, which has only one pyramid level. Each feature\\nvector is then fed into a sequence of FC layers before ﬁnally\\nbranching into two sibling output layers. One output layer is\\nresponsible for producing softmax probabilities for all C + 1\\ncategories (C object classes plus one “background” class)\\nand the other output layer encodes reﬁned bounding-box\\npositions with four real-valued numbers. All parameters in\\nthese procedures (except the generation of region proposals)\\nare optimized via a multitask loss in an end-to-end way.\\nThe multitasks loss L is deﬁned in the following to jointly\\ntrain classiﬁcation and bounding-box regression:\\nL(p, u, tu, v) = Lcls(p, u) + λ[u ≥1]Lloc(tu, v)\\n(1)\\nwhere Lcls(p, u) = −log pu calculates the log loss for ground\\ntruth class u, and pu is driven from the discrete probability\\ndistribution p = (p0, · · · , pC) over the C+1 outputs from the\\nlast FC layer. Lloc(tu, v) is deﬁned over the predicted offsets\\ntu = (tu\\nx , tu\\ny , tu\\nw, tu\\nh ) and ground-truth bounding-box regression\\ntargets v = (vx, vy, vw, vh), where x, y, w, and h denote\\nthe two coordinates of the box center, width, and height,\\nrespectively. Each tu adopts the parameter settings in [15] to\\nspecify an object proposal with a log-space height/width shift\\nand scale-invariant translation. The Iverson bracket indicator\\nfunction [u ≥1] is employed to omit all background RoIs.\\nTo provide more robustness against outliers and eliminate the\\nsensitivity in exploding gradients, a smooth L1 loss is adopted\\nto ﬁt bounding-box regressors as follows:\\nLloc(tu, v) =\\n\\x02\\ni∈x,y,w,h\\nsmoothL1\\n\\x03tu\\ni −vi\\n\\x04\\n(2)\\nwhere\\nsmoothL1(x) =\\n\\x05\\n0.5x2\\nif |x| < 1\\n|x| −0.5 otherwise.\\n(3)\\nTo accelerate the pipeline of Fast R-CNN, another two\\ntricks are of necessity. On the one hand, if training sam-\\nples (i.e., RoIs) come from different images, backpropagation\\nthrough the SPP layer becomes highly inefﬁcient. Fast R-CNN\\nsamples minibatches hierarchically, namely, N images sam-\\npled randomly at ﬁrst and then R/N RoIs sampled in each\\nimage, where R represents the number of RoIs. Critically,\\ncomputation and memory are shared by RoIs from the same\\nimage in the forward and backward pass. On the other hand,\\nmuch time is spent in computing the FC layers during the\\nforward pass [16]. The truncated singular value decomposition\\n(SVD) [91] can be utilized to compress large FC layers and\\nto accelerate the testing procedure.\\nIn the Fast R-CNN, regardless of region proposal genera-\\ntion, the training of all network layers can be processed in\\na single stage with a multitask loss. It saves the additional'),\n",

[17], [92] introduced an additional region\\nproposal network (RPN), which acts in a nearly cost-free way\\nby sharing full-image conv features with detection network.\\nRPN is achieved with an FCN, which has the ability to\\npredict object bounds and scores at each position simultane-\\nously. Similar to [78], RPN takes an image of arbitrary size to\\ngenerate a set of rectangular object proposals. RPN operates\\non a speciﬁc conv layer with the preceding layers shared with\\nthe object detection network.\\nThe architecture of RPN is shown in Fig. 6. The network\\nslides over the conv feature map and fully connects to an n×n\\nspatial window. A low-dimensional vector (512-dimensional\\nfor VGG16) is obtained in each sliding window and fed into\\ntwo sibling FC layers, namely, box-classiﬁcation layer (cls)\\nand box-regression layer (reg). This architecture is imple-\\nmented with an n × n conv layer followed by two sibling\\n1 × 1 conv layers. To increase nonlinearity, ReLU is applied\\nto the output of the n × n conv layer.\\nThe regressions toward true BBs are achieved by comparing\\nproposals relative to reference boxes (anchors). In the Faster\\nR-CNN, anchors of three scales and three aspect ratios are\\nadopted. The loss function is similar to (1)\\nL(pi, ti) =\\n1\\nNcls\\n\\x02\\ni\\nLcls\\n\\x03\\npi, p∗\\ni\\n\\x04\\n+ λ 1\\nNreg\\n\\x02\\ni\\np∗\\ni Lreg\\n\\x03\\nti, t∗\\ni\\n\\x04\\n(4)\\nwhere pi is the predicted probability of the ith anchor being an\\nobject. The ground truth label p∗\\ni is 1 if the anchor is positive,\\notherwise 0. ti stores four parameterized coordinates of the\\npredicted bounding box while t∗\\ni is related to the ground-truth\\nbox overlapping with a positive anchor. Lcls is a binary log loss\\nand Lreg is a smoothed L1 loss similar to (2). These two terms\\nare normalized with the minibatch size (Ncls) and the number\\nof anchor locations (Nreg), respectively. In the form of FCNs,\\nFaster R-CNN can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation\\nand SGD in an alternate training manner.\\nWith the proposal of Faster R-CNN, region proposal-based\\nCNN architectures for object detection can really be trained in\\nan end-to-end way. Also, a frame rate of 5 frames per second\\n(fps) on a GPU is achieved with the state-of-the-art object\\ndetection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. How-\\never, the alternate training algorithm is very time-consuming\\nand RPN produces objectlike regions (including backgrounds)\\ninstead of object instances and is not skilled in dealing with\\nobjects with extreme scales or shapes.\\n5) R-FCN: Divided by the RoI pooling layer, a preva-\\nlent family [16], [17] of deep networks for object detection\\nis composed of two subnetworks: a shared fully convolu-\\ntional subnetwork (independent of RoIs) and an unshared\\nRoI-wise subnetwork. This decomposition originates from\\npioneering classiﬁcation architectures (e.g., AlexNet [6] and\\nVGG16 [46]) which consist of a convolutional subnetwork and\\nseveral FC layers separated by a speciﬁc spatial pooling layer.\\nRecent state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation networks, such\\nas ResNets [47] and GoogLeNets [45], [93], are fully convo-\\nlutional. To adapt to these architectures, it is natural to con-\\nstruct a fully convolutional object detection network without\\nRoI-wise subnetwork. However, it turns out to be inferior\\nwith such a naive solution [47]. This inconsistency is due\\nto the dilemma of respecting translation variance in object\\ndetection compared with increasing translation invariance in\\nimage classiﬁcation. In other words, shifting an object inside\\nan image should be indiscriminative in image classiﬁcation\\nwhile any translation of an object in a bounding box may\\nbe meaningful in object detection. A manual insertion of\\nthe RoI pooling layer into convolutions can break down\\ntranslation invariance at the expense of additional unshared\\nregionwise layers. Therefore, Dai et al. [65] proposed an\\nR-FCNs (see Fig. S2 in the supplementary material).\\nDifferent from Faster R-CNN, for each category, the last\\nconv layer of R-FCN produces a total of k2 position-sensitive\\nscore maps with a ﬁxed grid of k × k ﬁrst and a position-\\nsensitive RoI pooling layer is then appended to aggregate\\nthe responses from these score maps. Finally, in each\\nRoI, k2 position-sensitive scores are averaged to produce a\\nC + 1-d vector and softmax responses across categories are\\ncomputed. Another 4k2-d conv layer is appended to obtain\\nclass-agnostic BBs.\\nWith\\nR-FCN,\\nmore\\npowerful\\nclassiﬁcation\\nnetworks\\ncan be adopted to accomplish object detection in a fully\\nconvolutional architecture by sharing nearly all the layers,\\nand the state-of-the-art results are obtained on both PASCAL\\nVOC and Microsoft COCO [94] data sets at a test speed\\nof 170 ms per image.\\n6) FPN: Feature pyramids built upon image pyramids\\n(featurized image pyramids) have been widely applied in many\\nobject detection systems to improve scale invariance [24], [64]\\n[Fig. 7(a)]. However, training time and memory consumption\\nincrease rapidly. To this end, some techniques take only\\na single input scale to represent high-level semantics and\\nincrease the robustness to scale changes [Fig. 7(b)], and image\\npyramids are built at test time which results in an inconsistency\\nbetween train/test-time inferences [16], [17]. The in-network\\nfeature hierarchy in a deep ConvNet produces feature maps of\\ndifferent spatial resolutions while introduces large semantic\\ngaps caused by different depths [Fig. 7(c)]. To avoid using\\nlow-level features, pioneer works [71], [95] usually build the\\npyramid starting from middle layers or just sum transformed'),\n",

(a) It is slow to use an image pyramid\\nto build a feature pyramid. (b) Only single-scale features are adopted for\\nfaster detection. (c) Alternative to the featurized image pyramid is to reuse\\nthe pyramidal feature hierarchy computed by a ConvNet. (d) FPN integrates\\nboth (b) and (c). Blue outlines indicate feature maps and thicker outlines\\ndenote semantically stronger features.\\nfeature responses, missing the higher resolution maps of the\\nfeature hierarchy.\\nDifferent from these approaches, FPN [66] holds an archi-\\ntecture with a BU pathway, a top-down (TD) pathway and\\nseveral lateral connections to combine low-resolution and\\nsemantically strong features with high-resolution and semanti-\\ncally weak features [Fig. 7(d)]. The BU pathway, which is the\\nbasic forward backbone ConvNet, produces a feature hierarchy\\nby downsampling the corresponding feature maps with a stride\\nof 2. The layers owning the same size of output maps are\\ngrouped into the same network stage and the output of the last\\nlayer of each stage is chosen as the reference set of feature\\nmaps to build the following TD pathway.\\nTo build the TD pathway, feature maps from higher network\\nstages are upsampled at ﬁrst and then enhanced with those of\\nthe same spatial size from the BU pathway via lateral connec-\\ntions. A 1 × 1 conv layer is appended to the upsampled map\\nto reduce channel dimensions and the mergence is achieved\\nby elementwise addition. Finally, a 3 × 3 convolution is also\\nappended to each merged map to reduce the aliasing effect\\nof upsampling and the ﬁnal feature map is generated. This\\nprocess is iterated until the ﬁnest resolution map is generated.\\nAs feature pyramid can extract rich semantics from all levels\\nand be trained end to end with all scales, the state-of-the-\\nart representation can be obtained without sacriﬁcing speed\\nand memory. Meanwhile, FPN is independent of the backbone\\nCNN architectures and can be applied to different stages of\\nobject detection (e.g., region proposal generation) and to many\\nother computer vision tasks (e.g., instance segmentation).\\n7) Mask R-CNN: Instance segmentation [96] is a challeng-\\ning task which requires detecting all objects in an image and\\nsegmenting each instance (semantic segmentation [97]). These\\ntwo tasks are usually regarded as two independent processes.\\nThe multitask scheme will create spurious edge and exhibit\\nsystematic errors on overlapping instances [98]. To solve this\\nproblem, parallel to the existing branches in Faster R-CNN\\nfor classiﬁcation and bounding box regression, the Mask R-\\nCNN [67] adds a branch to predict segmentation masks in a\\npixel-to-pixel manner (Fig. 8).\\nDifferent from the other two branches that are inevitably\\ncollapsed into short output vectors by FC layers, the segmen-\\ntation mask branch encodes an m × m mask to maintain the\\nexplicit object spatial layout. This kind of fully convolutional\\nFig. 8.\\nMask R-CNN framework for instance segmentation [67].\\nrepresentation requires fewer parameters but is more accurate\\nthan that in [97]. Formally, besides the two losses in (1) for\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding box regression, an additional loss\\nfor segmentation mask branch is deﬁned to reach a multitask\\nloss. This loss is only associated with ground-truth class and\\nrelies on the classiﬁcation branch to predict the category.\\nBecause RoI pooling, the core operation in Faster R-CNN,\\nperforms a coarse spatial quantization for feature extraction,\\nmisalignment is introduced between the RoI and the features.\\nIt affects classiﬁcation little because of its robustness to small\\ntranslations. However, it has a large negative effect on pixel-\\nto-pixel mask prediction. To solve this problem, Mask R-CNN\\nadopts a simple and quantization-free layer, namely, RoIAlign,\\nto preserve the explicit per-pixel spatial correspondence faith-\\nfully. RoIAlign is achieved by replacing the harsh quantization\\nof RoI pooling with bilinear interpolation [99], computing the\\nexact values of the input features at four regularly sampled\\nlocations in each RoI bin. In spite of its simplicity, this\\nseemingly minor change improves mask accuracy greatly,\\nespecially under strict localization metrics.\\nGiven the Faster R-CNN framework, the mask branch\\nonly adds a small computational burden and its cooperation\\nwith other tasks provides complementary information for\\nobject detection. As a result, Mask R-CNN is simple to\\nimplement with promising instance segmentation and object\\ndetection results. In a word, Mask R-CNN is a ﬂexible\\nand efﬁcient framework for instance-level recognition, which\\ncan be easily generalized to other tasks (e.g., human pose\\nestimation [7], [S4]) with minimal modiﬁcation.\\n8) Multitask Learning, Multiscale Representation, and Con-\\ntextual Modeling: Although the Faster R-CNN gets promising\\nresults with several hundred proposals, it still struggles in\\nsmall-size object detection and localization, mainly due to\\nthe coarseness of its feature maps and limited information\\nprovided in particular candidate boxes. The phenomenon is\\nmore obvious on the Microsoft COCO data set which consists\\nof objects at a broad range of scales, less prototypical images,\\nand requires more precise localization. To tackle these prob-\\nlems, it is of necessity to accomplish object detection with\\nmultitask learning [100], multiscale representation [95], and\\ncontext modeling [101] to combine complementary informa-\\ntion from multiple sources.\\nMultitask learning learns a useful representation for mul-\\ntiple correlated tasks from the same input [102], [103].\\nBrahmbhatt et al. [100] introduced conv features trained for\\nobject segmentation and “stuff” (amorphous categories such as\\nground and water) to guide accurate object detection of small\\nobjects (StuffNet).

Gidaris and Komodakis [110] proposed the multire-\\ngion CNN (MR-CNN) model to capture different aspects of\\nan object, the distinct appearances of various object parts,\\nand semantic segmentation-aware features.

[69] adopted an iterative classiﬁcation approach\\nto handle object detection and proposed an impressive end-\\nto-end CNN architecture named AttentionNet. Starting from\\nthe top-left and bottom-right corners of an image, Attention-\\nNet points to a target object by generating quantized weak\\ndirections and converges to an accurate object boundary box\\nwith an ensemble of iterative predictions. However, the model\\nbecomes quite inefﬁcient when handling multiple categories\\nwith a progressive two-step procedure.\\nNajibi\\net\\nal. [70]\\nproposed\\na\\nproposal-free\\niterative\\ngrid-based object detector (G-CNN), which models object\\ndetection as ﬁnding a path from a ﬁxed grid to boxes tightly\\nsurrounding the objects [70]. Starting with a ﬁxed multiscale\\nbounding box grid, G-CNN trains a regressor to move and\\nscale elements of the grid toward objects iteratively. However,\\nG-CNN has a difﬁculty in dealing with small or highly\\noverlapping objects.\\n2) YOLO: Redmon et al. [18] proposed a novel framework\\ncalled YOLO, which makes the use of the whole topmost\\nfeature map to predict both conﬁdences for multiple categories\\nand BBs. The basic idea of YOLO is exhibited in Fig. 9.\\nYOLO divides the input image into an S × S grid and each\\ngrid cell is responsible for predicting the object centered\\nin that grid cell. Each grid cell predicts B BBs and their\\ncorresponding conﬁdence scores. Formally, conﬁdence scores\\nare deﬁned as Pr(Object)∗IOUtruth\\npred, which indicates how likely\\nthere exist objects (Pr(Object) ≥0) and shows conﬁdences\\nof its prediction (IOUtruth\\npred). At the same time, regardless\\nof the number of boxes, C conditional class probabilities\\n(Pr(Classi|Object)) should also be predicted in each grid cell.\\nIt should be noticed that only the contribution from the grid\\ncell containing an object is calculated.\\nAt test time, class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each box\\nare achieved by multiplying the individual box conﬁdence\\npredictions with the conditional class probabilities as follows:\\nPr(Object) ∗IOUtruth\\npred ∗Pr(Classi|Object)\\n= Pr(Classi) ∗IOUtruth\\npred\\n(5)\\nwhere the existing probability of class-speciﬁc objects in the\\nbox and the ﬁtness between the predicted box and the object\\nare both taken into consideration.\\nDuring training, the following loss function is optimized:\\nλcoord\\nS2\\n\\x02\\ni=0\\nB\\n\\x02\\nj=0\\n\\x00obj\\nij [(xi −ˆxi)2 + (yi −ˆyi)2]\\n+ λcoord\\nS2\\n\\x02\\ni=0\\nB\\n\\x02\\nj=0\\n\\x00obj\\nij\\n\\x06\\x07√wi −\\n\\x08\\nˆwi)2 + (\\n\\x08\\nhi −\\n\\t\\nˆhi\\n\\n2\\x0b\\n+\\nS2\\n\\x02\\ni=0\\nB\\n\\x02\\nj=0\\n\\x00obj\\nij (Ci −ˆCi)2\\n+ λnoobj\\nS2\\n\\x02\\ni=0\\nB\\n\\x02\\nj=0\\n\\x00noobj\\nij\\n(Ci −ˆCi)2\\n+\\nS2\\n\\x02\\ni=0\\n\\x00obj\\ni\\n\\x02\\nc∈classes\\n(pi(c) −ˆpi(c))2.\\n(6)\\nIn a certain cell i, (xi, yi) denote the center of the box relative\\nto the bounds of the grid cell, (wi, hi) are the normalized width\\nand height relative to the image size, Ci represents the conﬁ-\\ndence scores,\\n\\x00obj\\ni\\nindicates the existence of objects, and\\n\\x00obj\\nij\\ndenotes that the prediction is conducted by the jth bounding\\nbox predictor. Note that only when an object is present in\\nthat grid cell, the loss function penalizes classiﬁcation errors.\\nSimilarly, when the predictor is “responsible” for the ground\\ntruth box (i.e., the highest IoU of any predictor in that grid cell\\nis achieved), bounding box coordinate errors are penalized.\\nThe YOLO consists of 24 conv layers and 2 FC layers,\\nof which some conv layers construct ensembles of inception\\nmodules with 1 × 1 reduction layers followed by 3 × 3 conv\\nlayers. The network can process images in real time at 45 fps\\nand a simpliﬁed version Fast YOLO can reach 155 fps\\nwith better results than other real-time detectors. Furthermore,\\nYOLO produces fewer false positives on the background,\\nwhich makes the cooperation with Fast R-CNN become pos-\\nsible. An improved version, YOLOv2, was later proposed\\nin [72], which adopts several impressive strategies, such as\\nBN, anchor boxes, dimension cluster, and multiscale training.\\n3) SSD: YOLO has a difﬁculty in dealing with small\\nobjects in groups, which is caused by strong spatial con-\\nstraints imposed on bounding box predictions [18]. Mean-\\nwhile, YOLO struggles to generalize to objects in new/unusual\\naspect ratios/conﬁgurations and produces relatively coarse\\nfeatures due to multiple downsampling operations.\\nAiming at these problems, Liu et al. [71] proposed an SSD,\\nwhich was inspired by the anchors adopted in MultiBox [68],\\nRPN [17], and multiscale representation [95]. Given a speciﬁc\\nfeature map, instead of ﬁxed grids adopted in YOLO, the SSD\\ntakes the advantage of a set of default anchor boxes with\\ndifferent aspect ratios and scales to discretize the output space\\nof BBs. To handle objects with various sizes, the network\\nfuses predictions from multiple feature maps with different\\nresolutions.\\nThe architecture of SSD is demonstrated in Fig. 10. Given\\nthe VGG16 backbone architecture, SSD adds several feature\\nlayers to the end of the network, which are responsible for\\npredicting the offsets to default boxes with different scales\\nand aspect ratios and their associated conﬁdences.

SALIENT OBJECT DETECTION\\nVisual saliency detection, one of the most important and\\nchallenging tasks in computer vision, aims to highlight the\\nmost dominant object regions in an image. Numerous appli-\\ncations incorporate the visual saliency to improve their perfor-\\nmance, such as image cropping [125] and segmentation [126],\\nimage retrieval [57], and object detection [66].\\nBroadly, there are two branches of approaches in salient\\nobject detection, namely, BU [127] and TD [128]. Local\\nfeature contrast plays the central role in BU salient object\\ndetection, regardless of the semantic contents of the scene.\\nTo learn local feature contrast, various local and global fea-\\ntures are extracted from pixels, e.g., edges [129] and spa-\\ntial information [130]. However, high-level and multiscale\\nsemantic information cannot be explored with these low-level\\nfeatures. As a result, low-contrast salient maps instead of\\nsalient objects are obtained. TD salient object detection is\\ntask-oriented and takes prior knowledge about object cate-\\ngories to guide the generation of salient maps. Taking semantic\\nsegmentation as an example, a saliency map is generated in the\\nsegmentation to assign pixels to particular object categories via\\na TD approach [131]. In a word, TD saliency can be viewed\\nas a focus-of-attention mechanism, which prunes BU salient\\npoints that are unlikely to be parts of the object [132].\\nA. Deep Learning in Salient Object Detection\\nDue to the signiﬁcance for providing high-level and mul-\\ntiscale feature representation and the successful applications\\nin many correlated computer vision tasks, such as semantic\\nsegmentation [131], edge detection [133], and generic object\\ndetection [16], it is feasible and necessary to extend CNN to\\nsalient object detection.\\nThe early work by Vig et al. [29] follows a completely\\nautomatic data-driven approach to perform a large-scale search\\nfor optimal features, namely, an ensemble of deep networks\\nwith different layers and parameters. To address the problem\\nof limited training data, Kummerer et al. [134] proposed the\\nDeep Gaze by transferring from the AlexNet to generate a\\nhigh-dimensional feature space and create a saliency map.\\nA similar architecture was proposed by Huang et al. [135] to\\nintegrate saliency prediction into pretrained object recognition\\nDNNs. The transfer is accomplished by ﬁne-tuning DNNs’\\nweights with an objective function based on the saliency\\nevaluation metrics, such as similarity, KL-divergence, and\\nnormalized scanpath saliency.\\nSome\\nworks\\ncombined\\nlocal\\nand\\nglobal\\nvisual\\nclues\\nto\\nimprove\\nsalient\\nobject\\ndetection\\nperformance.\\nWang et al.

To learn internal represen-\\ntations of saliency efﬁciently, He et al. [140] proposed a novel\\nsuperpixelwise CNN approach called SuperCNN, in which\\nsalient object detection is formulated as a binary labeling\\nproblem. Based on a fully CNN, Li et al. [141] proposed a\\nmultitask deep saliency model, in which intrinsic correlations\\nbetween saliency detection and semantic segmentation are set\\nup. However, due to the conv layers with large receptive\\nﬁelds and pooling layers, blurry object boundaries and coarse\\nsaliency maps are produced.

[148]\\nproposed a recurrent attentional convolutional–deconvolution\\nnetwork with several spatial transformer and recurrent network\\nunits to conquer this problem. To fuse local, global, and\\ncontextual information of salient objects, Tang et al. [149]\\ndeveloped a deeply supervised recurrent CNN to perform a\\nfull image-to-image saliency detection.\\nB. Experimental Evaluation\\nFour representative data sets, including Evaluation on Com-\\nplex Scene Saliency Dataset (ECSSD) [156], HKU-IS [146],\\nPASCALS [157], and SOD [158], are used to evaluate several\\nstate-of-the-art methods. ECSSD consists of 1000 structurally\\ncomplex but semantically meaningful natural images. HKU-IS\\nis a large-scale data set containing over 4000 challenging\\nimages. Most of these images have more than one salient\\nobject and own low contrast. PASCALS is a subset chosen\\nfrom the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2010 segmentation\\ndata set and is composed of 850 natural images. The SOD data\\nset possesses 300 images containing multiple salient objects.\\nThe training and validation sets for different data sets are kept\\nthe same as those in [152].\\nTwo standard metrics, namely, F-measure and the mean\\nabsolute error (MAE), are utilized to evaluate the quality of a\\nsaliency map.

FACE DETECTION\\nFace detection is essential to many face applications\\nand\\nacts\\nas\\nan\\nimportant\\npreprocessing\\nprocedure\\nto\\nface recognition [160]–[162], face synthesis [163], [164], and\\nfacial expression analysis [165]. Different from generic object\\ndetection, this task is to recognize and locate face regions\\ncovering a very large range of scales (30–300 pts versus\\n10–1000 pts). At the same time, faces have their unique object\\nstructural conﬁgurations (e.g., the distribution of different\\nface parts) and characteristics (e.g., skin color). All these\\ndifferences lead to special attention to this task. However, large\\nvisual variations of faces, such as occlusions, pose variations,\\nand illumination changes, impose great challenges for this task\\nin real applications.\\nThe most famous face detector proposed by Viola and\\nJones [166] trains cascaded classiﬁers with Haar-like features\\nand AdaBoost, achieving good performance with real-time\\nefﬁciency. However, this detector may degrade signiﬁcantly\\nin real-world applications due to larger visual variations of\\nhuman faces. Different from this cascade structure, Felzen-\\nszwalb et al.

However, for these traditional face detection\\nmethods, high computational expenses and large quantities\\nof annotations are required to achieve a reasonable result.\\nFig. 11.\\nROC curves of state-of-the-art methods on FDDB.

Deep Learning in Face Detection\\nRecently, some CNN-based face detection approaches have\\nbeen proposed [167]–[169]. As less accurate localization\\nresults from independent regressions of object coordinates,\\nYu et al. [167] proposed a novel IoU loss function for pre-\\ndicting the four bounds of box jointly. Farfade et al. [168]\\nproposed a deep dense face detector (DDFD) to conduct\\nmultiview face detection, which is able to detect faces in\\na wide range of orientations without the requirement of\\npose/landmark annotations. Yang et al. [169] proposed a novel\\ndeep learning-based face detection framework, which collects\\nthe responses from local facial parts (e.g., eyes, nose, and\\nmouths) to address face detection under severe occlusions\\nand unconstrained pose variations. Yang et al. [170] proposed\\na scale-friendly detection network named ScaleFace, which\\nsplits a large range of target scales into smaller subranges.\\nDifferent specialized subnetworks are constructed on these\\nsubscales and combined into a single one to conduct end-to-\\nend optimization. Hao et al. [171] designed an efﬁcient CNN\\nto predict the scale distribution histogram of the faces and took\\nthis histogram to guide the zoomed-in view and zoomed-out\\nview of the image. Since the faces are approximately in\\nuniform scale after zoom, compared with other state-of-the-art\\nbaselines, better performance is achieved with a less computa-\\ntion cost. In addition, some generic detection frameworks are\\nextended to face detection with different modiﬁcations, e.g.,\\nFaster R-CNN [30], [172], [173].\\nSome authors trained CNNs with other complementary\\ntasks, such as 3-D modeling and face landmarks, in a multitask\\nlearning manner.

In the framework, two issues are addressed to trans-\\nfer from generic object detection to face detection, namely,\\neliminating predeﬁned anchor boxes by a 3-D mean face\\nmodel and replacing RoI pooling layer with a conﬁguration\\npooling layer. Zhang et al. [176] proposed a deep cascaded\\nmultitask framework named multitask cascaded convolutional\\nnetworks (MTCNN) which exploits the inherent correlations\\nbetween face detection and alignment in the unconstrained\\nenvironment to boost up detection performance in a coarse-\\nto-ﬁne manner.\\nReducing computational expenses is of necessity in real\\napplications. To achieve real-time detection on the mobile plat-\\nform, Kalinovskii and Spitsyn [177] proposed a new solution\\nof frontal face detection based on compact CNN cascades. This\\nmethod takes a cascade of three simple CNNs to generate,\\nclassify, and reﬁne candidate object positions progressively.\\nTo reduce the effects of large pose variations, Chen et al. [32]\\nproposed a cascaded CNN denoted by supervised transformer\\nnetwork. This network takes a multitask RPN to predict\\ncandidate face regions along with associated facial landmarks\\nsimultaneously and adopts a generic R-CNN to verify the\\nexistence of valid faces. Yang and Nevatia [8] proposed a\\nthree-stage cascade structure based on FCNs, while in each\\nstage, a multiscale FCN is utilized to reﬁne the positions of\\npossible faces. Qin et al. [178] proposed a uniﬁed framework\\nthat achieves better results with the complementary informa-\\ntion from different jointly trained CNNs.\\nB. Experimental Evaluation\\nThe FDDB [179] data set has a total of 2845 pictures in\\nwhich 5171 faces are annotated with an elliptical shape. Two\\ntypes of evaluations are used: the discrete score and continuous\\nscore. By varying the threshold of the decision rule, the\\nreceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the discrete\\nscores can reﬂect the dependence of the detected face fractions\\non the number of false alarms. Compared with annotations,\\nany detection with an IoU ratio exceeding 0.5 is treated as\\npositive. Each annotation is only associated with one detection.\\nThe ROC curve for the continuous scores is the reﬂection of\\nface localization quality.\\nThe evaluated models cover DDFD [168], Cascade-CNN\\n[180], aggregate channel features (ACF)-multiscale [181],\\nPico [182], Head-Hunter [183], Joint Cascade [31], SURF-\\nmultiview [184],\\nViola–Jones [166],\\nNPDFace [185],\\nFaceness [169], convolutional channel features (CCF) [186],\\nMTCNN [176],\\nConv3-D [175],\\nHyperface [187],\\nUnitBox\\n[167],\\nlocally\\ndecorrelated\\nchannel\\nfeatures (LDCF+)\\n[S2], DeepIR [173],\\nhybrid-resolution\\nmodel\\nwith\\nelliptical\\nregressor (HR-ER) [188],\\nFace-R-\\nCNN [172],\\nand\\nScaleFace [170].\\nACF-multiscale,\\nPico,\\nHeadHunter, Joint Cascade, SURF-multiview, Viola-Jones,\\nNPDFace, and LDCF+ are built on classic hand-crafted\\nfeatures while the rest methods are based on deep CNN\\nfeatures. The ROC curves are shown in Fig. 11.\\nIn Fig. 11(a), in spite of relatively competitive results pro-\\nduced by LDCF+, it can be observed that most of the classic\\nmethods perform with similar results and are outperformed by\\nCNN-based methods by a signiﬁcant margin. In Fig. 11(b),\\nit can be observed that most of the CNN-based methods earn\\nsimilar true positive rates between 60% and 70% while DeepIR\\nand HR-ER perform much better than them. Among classic\\nmethods, Joint Cascade is still competitive. As earlier works,\\nDDFD and CCF directly make use of generated feature maps\\nand obtain relatively poor results. CascadeCNN builds cas-\\ncaded CNNs to locate face regions, which is efﬁcient but inac-\\ncurate. Faceness combines the decisions from different part\\ndetectors, resulting in precise face localizations while being\\ntime-consuming. The outstanding performance of MTCNN,\\nConv3-D, and Hyperface proves the effectiveness of multitask\\nlearning. HR-ER and ScaleFace adaptively detect faces of\\ndifferent scales and make a balance between accuracy and\\nefﬁciency. DeepIR and Face-R-CNN are two extensions of the\\nFaster R-CNN architecture to face detection, which validate\\nthe signiﬁcance and effectiveness of Faster R-CNN. Unitbox\\nprovides an alternative choice for performance improvements\\nby carefully designing optimization loss.\\nFrom these results, we can draw the conclusion that\\nCNN-based methods are in the leading position. The perfor-\\nmance can be improved by the following strategies: designing\\nnovel optimization loss, modifying generic detection pipelines,\\nbuilding meaningful network cascades, adapting scale-aware\\ndetection, and learning multitask shared CNN features.\\nVI.

In the meantime, the main\\nsource of false predictions in pedestrian detection is the\\nconfusion of hard background instances, which is in contrast\\nto the interference from multiple categories in generic object\\ndetection. As a result, different conﬁgurations and components\\nare required to accomplish accurate pedestrian detection.\\nA. Deep Learning in Pedestrian Detection\\nAlthough DCNNs have obtained excellent performance on\\ngeneric object detection [16], [72], none of these approaches\\nhave achieved better results than the best hand-crafted feature-\\nbased method [198] for a long time, even when part-based\\ninformation and occlusion handling are incorporated [202].\\nThereby, some studies have been conducted to analyze\\nthe reasons.

[204] proposed a deep learning\\nframework called DeepParts, which makes decisions based\\non an ensemble of extensive part detectors. DeepParts has\\nadvantages in dealing with weakly labeled data, low IoU\\npositive proposals, and partial occlusion.\\nOther researchers also tried to combine complementary\\ninformation from multiple data sources. CompACT-Deep\\nadopts a complexity-aware cascade to combine hand-crafted\\nfeatures and ﬁne-tuned DCNNs [195]. Based on Faster\\nR-CNN, Liu et al. [205] proposed multispectral DNNs for\\npedestrian detection to combine complementary information\\nfrom color and thermal images. Tian et al. [206] proposed\\na task-assistant CNN to jointly learn multiple tasks with\\nmultiple data sources and to combine pedestrian attributes\\nwith semantic scene attributes together. Du et al. [207] pro-\\nposed a DNN fusion architecture for fast and robust pedes-\\ntrian detection. Based on the candidate BBs generated with\\nSSD detectors [71], multiple binary classiﬁers are processed\\nparallelly to conduct soft-rejection-based network fusion by\\nconsulting their aggregated degree of conﬁdences.\\nHowever, most of these approaches are much more sophisti-\\ncated than the standard R-CNN framework. CompACT-Deep\\nconsists of a variety of hand-crafted features, a small CNN\\nmodel, and a large VGG16 model [195]. DeepParts contains\\n45 ﬁne-tuned DCNN models, and a set of strategies, includ-\\ning bounding box shifting handling and part selection, are\\nrequired to arrive at the reported results [204]. Therefore,\\nthe modiﬁcation and simpliﬁcation are of signiﬁcance to\\nreduce the burden on both software and hardware to satisfy\\nreal-time detection demand. Tome et al. [59] proposed a novel\\nsolution to adapt generic object detection pipeline to pedestrian\\ndetection by optimizing most of its stages. Hu et al. [208]\\ntrained an ensemble of boosted decision models by reusing\\nthe conv feature maps, and a further improvement was gained\\nwith simple pixel labeling and additional complementary\\nhand-crafted features. Tome et al. [209] proposed a reduced\\nmemory region-based deep CNN architecture, which fuses\\nregional responses from both ACF detectors and SVM classi-\\nﬁers into R-CNN. Ribeiro et al. [33] addressed the problem of\\nhuman-aware navigation and proposed a vision-based person\\ntracking system guided by multiple camera sensors.\\nB. Experimental Evaluation\\nThe evaluation is conducted on the most popular Caltech\\nPedestrian data set [3]. The data set was collected from the\\nvideos of a vehicle driving through an urban environment and\\nconsists of 250000 frames with about 2300 unique pedestrians\\nand 350000 annotated BBs. Three kinds of labels, namely,\\n“Person (clear identiﬁcations),” “Person? (unclear identiﬁca-\\ntions),” and “People (large group of individuals),” are assigned\\nto different BBs. The performance is measured with the\\nlog-average miss rate (L-AMR) which is computed evenly\\nspaced in log-space in the range 10−2 to 1 by averaging miss\\nrate at the rate of nine false positives per image [3]. According\\nto the differences in the height and visible part of the BBs,\\na total of nine popular settings are adopted to evaluate different\\nproperties of these models. Details of these settings are as\\nin [3].\\nEvaluated\\nmethods\\ninclude\\nCheckerboards+ [198],\\nLDCF++ [S2], SCF+AlexNet [210], SA-FastRCNN [211],\\nMS-CNN [105],\\nDeepParts [204],\\nCompACT-Deep [195],\\nRPN+BF [203],\\nand\\nF-DNN+SS [207].\\nThe\\nﬁrst\\ntwo\\nmethods are based on hand-crafted features while the rest\\nones rely on deep CNN features. All results are exhibited\\nin Table VII. From this table, we observe that different\\nfrom other tasks, classic handcrafted features can still earn\\ncompetitive\\nresults\\nwith\\nboosted\\ndecision\\nforests [203],\\nACF [197], and HOG+LUV channels [S2]. As an early\\nattempt to adapt CNN to pedestrian detection, the features\\ngenerated by SCF+AlexNet are not so discriminant and\\nproduce relatively poor results. Based on multiple CNNs,\\nDeepParts and CompACT-Deep accomplish detection tasks via\\ndifferent strategies, namely, local part integration and cascade\\nnetwork. The responses from different local part detectors\\nmake DeepParts robust to partial occlusions. However, due\\nto complexity, it is too time-consuming to achieve real-time\\ndetection. The multiscale representation of MS-CNN improves\\nthe accuracy of pedestrian locations. SA-FastRCNN extends\\nFast R-CNN to automatically detect pedestrians according\\nto their different scales, which has trouble when there are\\npartial occlusions. RPN+BF combines the detectors produced\\nby Faster R-CNN with boosting decision forest to accurately\\nlocate different pedestrians. F-DNN+SS, which is composed\\nof multiple parallel classiﬁers with soft rejections, performs\\nthe best followed by RPN+BF, SA-FastRCNN, and MS-CNN.\\nIn short, CNN-based methods can provide more accu-\\nrate candidate boxes and multilevel semantic information for\\nidentifying and locating pedestrians. Meanwhile, handcrafted\\nfeatures are complementary and can be combined with CNN\\nto achieve better results. The improvements over existing CNN\\nmethods can be obtained by carefully designing the framework\\nand classiﬁers, extracting multiscale and part-based semantic\\ninformation and searching for complementary information\\nfrom other related tasks, such as segmentation.\\nVII. PROMISING FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND TASKS\\nIn spite of rapid development and achieved promising\\nprogress of object detection, there are still many open issues\\nfor the future work.\\nThe ﬁrst one is small object detection such as occurring\\nin COCO data set and in face detection task. To improve\\nlocalization accuracy on small objects under partial occlusions,\\nit is necessary to modify network architectures from the\\nfollowing aspects.\\n1) Multitask\\nJoint\\nOptimization\\nand\\nMultimodal\\nInformation Fusion: Due to the correlations between\\ndifferent tasks within and outside object detection,\\nmultitask joint optimization has already been studied\\nby many researchers [16], [17]. However, apart from\\nthe tasks mentioned in Section III-A8, it is desirable to\\nthink over the characteristics of different subtasks of\\nobject detection (e.g., superpixel semantic segmentation\\nin\\nsalient\\nobject\\ndetection)\\nand\\nextend\\nmultitask\\noptimization to other applications such as instance\\nsegmentation [66],\\nmultiobject\\ntracking [202],\\nand\\nmultiperson pose estimation [S4].

To increase the robustness to scale\\nchanges, it is demanded to train scale-invariant, mul-\\ntiscale or scale-adaptive detectors. For scale-invariant\\ndetectors, more powerful backbone architectures (e.g.,\\nResNext [123]), negative sample mining [113], reverse\\nconnection [213], and subcategory modeling [60] are all\\nbeneﬁcial. For multiscale detectors, both the FPN [66]\\nthat produces multiscale feature maps and the generative\\nadversarial network [214] that narrows representation\\ndifferences between small objects and the large ones\\nwith a low-cost architecture provide insights into gen-\\nerating meaningful feature pyramid. For scale-adaptive\\ndetectors, it is useful to combine knowledge graph [215],\\nattentional mechanism [216], cascade network [180],\\nand scale distribution estimation [171] to detect objects\\nadaptively.\\n3) Spatial Correlations and Contextual Modeling: Spatial\\ndistribution plays an important role in object detec-\\ntion. Therefore, region proposal generation and grid\\nregression are taken to obtain probable object loca-\\ntions. However, the correlations between multiple pro-\\nposals and object categories are ignored. In addition,\\nthe global structure information is abandoned by the\\nposition-sensitive score maps in R-FCN. To solve these\\nproblems, we can refer to diverse subset selection [217]\\nand sequential reasoning tasks [218] for possible solu-\\ntions. It is also meaningful to mask salient parts and\\ncouple them with the global structure in a joint-learning\\nmanner [219].\\nThe second one is to release the burden on manual labor\\nand accomplish real-time object detection, with the emergence\\nof the large-scale image and video data. The following three\\naspects can be taken into account.\\n1) Cascade Network:\\nIn\\na\\ncascade network, a cas-\\ncade\\nof\\ndetectors\\nis\\nbuilt\\nin\\ndifferent stages\\nor\\nlayers [180], [220]. Easily distinguishable examples are\\nrejected at shallow layers so that features and classiﬁers\\nat later stages can handle more difﬁcult samples with\\nthe aid of the decisions from previous stages. However,\\ncurrent cascades are built in a greedy manner, where\\nprevious stages in cascade are ﬁxed when training a new\\nstage. Therefore, the optimizations of different CNNs\\nare isolated, which stresses the necessity of end-to-end\\noptimization for CNN cascade. At the same time, it is\\nalso a matter of concern to build contextual associated\\ncascade networks with existing layers.\\n2) Unsupervised and Weakly Supervised Learning: It is\\nvery time-consuming to manually draw large quantities\\nof BBs. To release this burden, semantic prior [55],\\nunsupervised object discovery [221], multiple instance\\nlearning [222], and DNN prediction [47] can be inte-\\ngrated to make the best use of image-level supervision\\nto assign object category tags to corresponding object\\nregions and reﬁne object boundaries. Furthermore,\\nweakly annotations (e.g., center-click annotations [223])\\nare also helpful for achieving high-quality detectors with\\nmodest annotation efforts, especially aided by the mobile\\nplatform.\\n3) Network Optimization: Given speciﬁc applications and\\nplatforms, it is signiﬁcant to make a balance among\\nspeed, memory, and accuracy by selecting an optimal\\ndetection architecture [116], [224]. However, despite\\nthat detection accuracy is reduced, it is more mean-\\ningful to learn compact models with a fewer number\\nof parameters [209]. This situation can be relieved by\\nintroducing better pretraining schemes [225], knowledge\\ndistillation [226], and hint learning [227]. DSOD also\\nprovides a promising guideline to train from scratch\\nto bridge the gap between different image sources and\\ntasks [74].\\nThe\\nthird\\none\\nis\\nto\\nextend\\ntypical\\nmethods\\nfor\\n2-D\\nobject\\ndetection\\nto\\nadapt\\n3-D\\nobject\\ndetection\\nand video object detection, with the requirements from\\nautonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and intelligent\\nsurveillance.\\n1) 3-D Object Detection: With the applications of 3-D\\nsensors (e.g., Light Detection and Ranging and cam-\\nera), additional depth information can be utilized to\\nbetter understand the images in 2-D and extend the\\nimage-level knowledge to the real world. However, sel-\\ndom of these 3-D-aware techniques aim to place correct\\n3-D BBs around detected objects. To achieve better\\nbounding results, multiview representation [181] and\\n3-D proposal network [228] may provide some guide-\\nlines to encode depth information with the aid of inertial\\nsensors (accelerometer and gyrometer) [229].'),\n",

To this\\nend, spatiotemporal tubelets [230], optical ﬂow [199],\\nand LSTM [107] should be considered to fundamentally\\nmodel object associations between consecutive frames.\\nVIII. CONCLUSION\\nDue to its powerful learning ability and advantages in\\ndealing with occlusion, scale transformation, and background\\nswitches, deep learning-based object detection has been a\\nresearch hotspot in recent years. This paper provides a detailed\\nreview on deep learning-based object detection frameworks\\nthat handle different subproblems, such as occlusion, clutter,\\nand low resolution, with different degrees of modiﬁcations\\non R-CNN. The review starts on generic object detection\\npipelines which provide base architectures for other related\\ntasks. Then, three other common tasks, namely, salient object\\ndetection, face detection, and pedestrian detection, are also\\nbrieﬂy reviewed. Finally, we propose several promising future\\ndirections to gain a thorough understanding of the object detec-\\ntion landscape.
